Write academic papers of Elsevier journals.

One of my academic manuscripts, published on *Agricultural and Forest Meteorology*, was the first paper of mine written in R bookdown environment from the preparation to the publication. Hooray! 

Elsevier is one of the world's major providers of scientific, technical, and medical information. Elsevier owns  2500 journals, which is why I would like to share my bookdown manuscript for re-use.

Elsevier provides a [LaTeX template](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-schemas/latex-instructions) which is free for using. I modified it as 'tex/template.tex', i.e. something was moved from the original LaTeX template to the yaml of 'index.Rmd'. Users could simply compare them and then get an idea how to convert a LaTeX template into a bookdown template.

Here is a brief description for re-use:

- Install R and RStudio.
- Install R bookdown package and R bookdownplus package.
- Create a skeleton of the manuscript.
- Revise the .Rmd files as your own.
- Build the book.
