Write academic manuscript in Chinese with bilingual titles, author lists, abstracts, and keywords.

> by Peng Zhao (demo: [pdf](https://github.com/pzhaonet/bookdownplus/raw/master/inst2/paper_zh/showcase/paper_zh.pdf), [zip](https://github.com/pzhaonet/bookdownplus/raw/master/inst/templates/paper_zh.zip))

The pdf template of bookdown-paper_zh originated from a LaTeX template I collected somewhere during the early days of my learning LaTeX. I modified it as 'tex/template_paper_zh.tex'.

Here is a brief description for re-use:

- Install R and RStudio.
- Install R bookdown package and R bookdownplus package.
- Create a skeleton of the manuscript.
- Revise the .Rmd files as your own.
- Build the book.
