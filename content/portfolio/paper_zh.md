The pdf template of bookdown-paper_zh originated from a LaTeX template I collected somewhere during the early days of my learning LaTeX. I modified it as 'tex/template_paper_zh.tex'.

Install R, bookdown, LaTeX, and bookdownplus. Then run the following code in R language to create a book from this template:

```r
library('bookdownplus')
bd('paper_zh')
```
